<h3>life story</h3>
<p><i> HTML is the standard markup language use for displaying designed documents in web browser. Without this language,
 it is nearly impossible to organize text, add videos or images in the web pagepHe
 was handed a Test debut on a minefield of a track in Mumbai in late 2004 against Australia.
 However, a string of low scores made way for other keeper-batsmen in the fringes. After the
 emergence of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Karthik has made comebacks into the side as a pure batsman 
 but failed to topple over Dhoni for the wicketkeeping position. The highest point in his career
 arrived when Karthik, replaced Sehwag in the 2007 tour of England as an opener. Showing a stoic,
 airtight technique in unfavorable conditions, he ended the Test series as India's highest 
 run-getter, ahead of some big names like Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, and Sachin Tendulkar,
 playing a significant role in handing India an elusive away series win.</i> </p>

<h5>INDIAN PREMIER LEAUGE</h5>
<p>What are the surnames of Bangladesh's lower class/poor people and upper class/aristocratic
 people?
The surnames Chowdhury, Talukdar, Sheikh, Pramanik, Mondol etc are common amongst the upper class but it doesn’t guarantee wealth, a person with such a surname could be dirt poor too.
Lower class poor could also have similar surnames or they may not have any surnames, surnames 
aren’t really that widespread.
People also have hasan, hossain, ali, osman, islam, siddik etc as surnames, these are
 common amongst all classes of people.
These aren’t the only surnames, there are many others especially amongst Hindus</p>
